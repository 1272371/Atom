    This is is a web based application allowing lecturers to view students in their classes,
    view their respective marks and run a prediction algorithm to tell whether the student is
    at risk of failure so that systems can be put in place to prevent said student from failing.

    This application will follow a client-server model. The server will hold the actual website
    and the code that links to the machine learning algorithm and the plotting tools. When the
    user opens the website they will be greeted by a login screen resembling the Wits Sakai system.
    <h3></h3>
    We will be using restful API to connect theweb browser to the server. They will need to put in
    their username and password (should be linked to the Wits system so as to allow lecturers to use
    their Sakai login details). Once successfully logged in, they will be redirected to the dashboard.
    <h3></h3>

    Here they will be able to select from 3 tabs on the left side menu: Dashboard, Grade Book, Statistics.
    On the dashboard page the user will see a block showing information about the currently selected student,
    then another block with their marks, then another block to allow the user to select a new student.
    Underneath all this will be a graph plotting the prediction for the current student.
