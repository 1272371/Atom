                            <p>This is is a web based application allowing lecturers to view students in their classes, view their respective marks and run a prediction algorithm to tell whether the student is at risk of failure so that systems can be put in place to prevent said student from failing. </p>

                            <p>This application will follow a client-server model. The server will hold the actual website and the code that links to the machine learning algorithm, the plotting tools and the database. When the user opens the website they will be greeted by a login screen resembling the Wits Sakai system. We will be using restful API to connect theweb browser to the server. They will need to put in their username and password (should be linked to the Wits system so as to allow lecturers to use their Sakai login details). Once successfully logged in, they will be redirected to the dashboard. </p>
                            
                            <p>There is a feature which allows the user to upload a CSV file to the website and have that data be added to our database. This section of the website will follow a layered system as there will be the outer layer which is the User Interface itself, then a layer lower which will be the User being able to see what the data looks like on our system and then a lower layer which verifies that all the necessary data has been inputted (our system and database verification for the business rules and following proper table structure) and only once all these checks return positive, will the data actually be uploaded to the database. We use this system because it is:</p>
